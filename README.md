# NSU-Study-Portal
This is my CSE 425 project with my contributor Hafeza Akter. NSU-Study-Portal is a web based software where a student can Register/Login, Add Notes, Add Homework, view pending homeworks, lodge complaint, search for any books &amp; read for free, Search for any definition etc. Users can utilize the portal's book search feature to look for books using a variety of criteria. Users can access comprehensive information on books, including titles, authors, publishing dates, descriptions, and reviews, by utilizing the usage of the Google Books API.
